üé¨ AMC MCP Server Project Outline
üî≠ High-Level Summary

You are building an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, LangChain agents, etc.) to interact with AMC Theatres APIs.

The MCP server will act as a secure, structured bridge between LLMs and AMC‚Äôs systems, enabling:

Listing movies currently playing

Listing theaters near a user

Showing showtimes for a specific theater

(Future) Reserving tickets for A-List/Stubs users (requires AMC vendor auth)

The server should follow MCP best practices:

Provide structured JSON schemas for inputs/outputs

Expose tools/resources with clear descriptions

Handle auth (AMC API key + optional user tokens) securely

Be deployable (Docker, HTTPS) and usable by any LLM client that supports MCP

üóÇÔ∏è Detailed Plan
1. MCP Server Core

Build the server in TypeScript with Express.

Implement MCP-compliant endpoints under /tools/*.

Expose the following tools:

list_theaters(zip: string) ‚Üí returns theaters near the given ZIP code

list_movies() ‚Üí returns now-playing movies

list_showtimes(theaterId: string, date: string) ‚Üí returns showtimes for a given theater on a date

reserve_tickets(...) (stub only, to be implemented when AMC grants e-commerce access)

2. AMC API Wrapper

Create a lightweight AMC client module (amcClient.ts).

Handle all requests to https://api.amctheatres.com/v2/... with the header:

X-AMC-Vendor-Key: YOUR_API_KEY


Functions to implement:

getNowPlayingMovies()

getTheatersByZip(zip)

getShowtimes(theaterId, date)

Add error handling for non-200 responses.

Respect pagination in API responses.

3. Types & Data Models

Define TypeScript types for:

Movie (id, title, runtime, releaseDate)

Theater (id, name, address)

Showtime (id, startDateTime, auditorium)

Format outputs into clean JSON (no unnecessary metadata) so LLMs can reason about results.

4. Authentication

MVP: Use AMC API key (from developer portal).

Phase 2: Add per-user auth flow for AMC accounts (Stubs/A-List).

Securely store tokens (encrypted in DB or in-memory session).

Expose check_loyalty_status tool to query account info.

Gate reserve_tickets behind user login.

5. MCP Integration

Provide a manifest.json for MCP discovery, describing your server‚Äôs tools.

Example:

{
  "name": "amc-mcp-server",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "tools": [
    { "name": "list_movies", "description": "List now-playing AMC movies" },
    { "name": "list_theaters", "description": "Find AMC theaters by ZIP" },
    { "name": "list_showtimes", "description": "Showtimes for a theater on a date" }
  ]
}


Test integration in Claude Desktop by pointing it to your server.

6. Deployment

Containerize with Docker.

Deploy to a host like Render, Fly.io, or AWS Lightsail.

Enforce HTTPS and require an MCP client token to prevent public abuse.

Add logging + rate limiting.

7. User Experience Flow

Example conversation:

User: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs playing at AMC Century City tonight?‚Äù

LLM ‚Üí list_theaters(zip=90067) ‚Üí gets theater ID.

LLM ‚Üí list_showtimes(theaterId=118, date=2025-08-17) ‚Üí gets movie + times.

LLM ‚Üí presents results in natural language.

(Future) User: ‚ÄúBook two tickets for Dune at 7pm.‚Äù ‚Üí reserve_tickets(...).

8. Stretch Goals

Add check_loyalty_status ‚Üí query if user is A-List / Insider / Premiere.

Add seat map selection (grid text format).

Add notifications (‚Äúnotify me when a new IMAX release opens‚Äù).

Integrate with LangChain so any agent can access the same MCP server.

üöÄ Suggested Milestones

 1:

Setup TypeScript project + MCP skeleton

Implement AMC API wrapper (list_movies, list_theaters, list_showtimes)

Test endpoints locally

 2:

Add JSON schemas for cleaner responses

Implement manifest.json for MCP autodiscovery

Connect to Claude Desktop and test

 3:

Add Dockerfile + deploy to Render/Fly.io

Secure with HTTPS + API auth token

Add basic logging & monitoring

Future:

Explore vendor auth for reservations

Add loyalty integration + secure user sessions
